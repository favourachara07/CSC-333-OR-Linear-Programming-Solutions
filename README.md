# CSC 333: Linear Programming Solutions


*Description*

This repository stores solutions to the Linear Programming (LP) problems given in the CSC 333 Lab Assignment 1. The assignment focuses on solving LP problems graphically and programmatically using Python.

*Objectives*

- Solve LP problems graphically by hand and display the solutions.
- Use Python to graphically solve LP problems by plotting constraints, identifying feasible regions, and determining the optimal solutions.
- Share the results and methodology through this GitHub repository.

*Repository Contents*

- *Hand-Solved Solutions*: Scanned PDFs or images of the graphical solutions showing constraints, feasible regions, and optimal solutions.
- *Python Code*: Scripts written in Python (e.g., (link unavailable)) that use libraries like matplotlib, numpy, and scipy (or pulp) to solve the LP problems graphically.
- *(link unavailable)*: This file provides an overview of the repository, the steps involved in solving the problems, and instructions for running the Python code.
- *Results*: Outputs from the Python scripts, including plots showing the feasible regions and optimal points.

*Getting Started*

*Prerequisites*

- Python (>=3.8)
- Python libraries: matplotlib, numpy, scipy, or pulp
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running scripts interactively)

*Installation*

1. Clone this repository: `git clone (link unavailable)
2. Install required libraries: `pip install matplotlib numpy scipy pulp`

*Running the Python Code*

1. Navigate to the Python script directory.
2. Run the script in the terminal or use Jupyter Notebook: `python (link unavailable)`

*Viewing Results*

The script will display plots for each LP problem, showing constraints, the feasible region, corner points, and the optimal solution. Refer to the `results/` directory for saved plots and output files.

*Methodology*

*Hand-Solved Solutions*

1. Graph the constraints for each problem on graph paper.
2. Identify and shade the feasible region.
3. Mark the corner points of the feasible region.
4. Calculate the optimal solution by evaluating the objective function at each corner point.

*Python Graphical Solution*

1. Define the constraints and the objective function.
2. Use matplotlib to graph the constraints.
3. Shade the feasible region programmatically.
4. Use scipy or pulp to identify and validate the optimal solution.
5. Plot the solution on the graph.
